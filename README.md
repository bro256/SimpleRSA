# RSA Encryption/Decryption in Python

This is a Python program that demonstrates a basic implementation of RSA encryption and decryption using core building blocks like prime number generation, modular arithmetic, and modular exponentiation. The program uses the RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt a message.

## Features

- **Manual RSA Key Generation**: Generates RSA keys by computing large prime numbers `p` and `q`.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts a message using the public key `(e, n)`.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts the ciphertext back to the original message using the private key `(d, n)`.
- **Custom Key Size**: Allows for changing the RSA key size by providing it as a command-line argument.
- **Message Length Check**: Verifies that the message is small enough to be encrypted with the generated key size.

## Requirements

The program uses the following libraries:

- [PyCryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/) for random prime number generation.
- [libnum](https://pypi.org/project/libnum/) for modular inverse computation.

To install the dependencies, use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Program
To run the program, use:
```bash
python rsa.py [message] [key_size]
```
- **message**: The message to be encrypted (optional, default is "Hello").
- **key_size**: The size of the RSA key in bits (optional, default is 2048 bits).

## How It Works

### Key Generation

The program begins by generating two large prime numbers, `p` and `q`, using the `getPrime` function from the PyCryptodome library. The product of these two primes, `n`, is used as the modulus in both the public and private keys. The Eulerâ€™s totient function, `phi`, is calculated as `(p-1) * (q-1)`. The public exponent `e` is set to the common value `65537`, and the private exponent `d` is calculated as the modular inverse of `e` modulo `phi` using the `invmod` function from the libnum library.
